" MY FIRST PROJECTS "

Good manual tester can contribute to delivering a high-quality software product by identifying defects, ensuring system stability, and providing valuable insights to the development team - I am sure that knowledge of the SCRUM methodology will help me in this.

As a manual tester, I understand how important it is to be able to work in a team, focus on customer needs, as well as accuracy and patience in the tasks performed.
I can develop a test plan outlining the scope, objectives, and approach to testing. Define test scenarios, test cases, and test data based on the requirements. 
Prioritize testing activities and create a timeline for execution.

Create well-defined test cases that cover different scenarios, including positive and negative test cases.
Test cases should be clear, concise, and include step-by-step instructions to execute them. 
Testers should also consider boundary conditions, edge cases, and potential system failures.

Execute test cases according to the test plan. Report defects accurately, providing detailed steps to reproduce the issues. 
Use different techniques like exploratory testing to uncover additional defects that might not be covered by the test cases.

Perform regression testing after bug fixes or new feature implementations to ensure that previously working functionality has not been affected by the changes. 
This helps maintain the overall system stability.

Collaborate effectively with developers, business analysts, and other stakeholders. Communicate findings, defects, and test progress to the relevant parties in a clear and concise manner. Actively participate in discussions and provide valuable input to improve the overall quality of the product.

Maintain accurate and up-to-date documentation of test cases, test results, and any issues encountered during testing.
This documentation helps in knowledge sharing and serves as a reference for future testing cycles.

Pay close attention to details while executing test cases and analyzing results. 
A good manual tester should have a keen eye for spotting anomalies and potential issues within the system.
